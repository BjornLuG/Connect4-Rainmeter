# Connect4 for Rainmeter
Play the classic Connect4 game on desktop!

## Notes
The game was quickly whipped up so the skin will look simple for now.

Although it works fine on my machine, do send an issue if there's any other bugs :)

Do excuse the ugly code, I don't know what happened in there but it's horrifying.

## Todo
- Disc falling animation when restarting game
- Better text UI
- Cleaner code
- Document code
